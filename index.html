  <p>October felt like the longest month ever.</p>
</div>
<div>
  <p>Scotland basically went back into lockdown. The pubs are shut again, so its back to long walks in your health board and drinking on Zoom again (kidding, please let that die with lockdown #1).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A second lockdown is pending and at the time of writing it looks like Trump’s gonna win the election, lemme hear you scream!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As for the playlist, it started off strong! Upbeat, a bit dancey, just all round good vibes. Then I watched Lost in Translation and everything got a bit Sofia Coppola- cue MBV (it would be When You Sleep or Sometimes, but Only Shallow will have to do – put Loveless back on Spotify, you cowards).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Three uni assignments all due within a week of each other meant my YouTube searches became more and more male manipulator as the week went on, hence the inclusion of Neutral Milk Hotel. And, of course, my favourite sad girl Julia Jacklin released a new single- the B-side of which rounds off this month’s playlist.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Here’s to November being not as scary.</p>
